# Shiki, TwoSlash, and Rehype: What's All That?

Creating high-quality technical documentation and blog posts means presenting code that is not only readable but also informative. Static, plainly-colored code blocks are a thing of the past. Modern tools allow us to create rich, interactive, and beautifully highlighted code examples.

Enter the powerful trio: Shiki, TwoSlash, and Rehype. This post will break down what each tool does and how they work together to transform your markdown and MDX code blocks into a superior learning experience for your readers.
