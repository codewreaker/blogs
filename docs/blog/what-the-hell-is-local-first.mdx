# What the Hell is Local-First?

For the last decade, we've been building "cloud-first" applications, where the authoritative copy of data lives on a server and the client is just a thin veneer. But what if we flipped that model? What if the primary copy of the data lived on the user's device? This is the core idea behind Local-First architecture.

Local-first applications are faster, work offline, and give users true ownership of their data. In this post, we'll explore this exciting paradigm shift, its seven key ideals, and the enabling technologies like Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) that make seamless, multi-user collaboration possible.
