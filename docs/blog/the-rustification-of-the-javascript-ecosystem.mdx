# The Rustification of the JavaScript Ecosystem

For years, the tools we've used to build for the web have been built *with* the web's languages, primarily JavaScript. But a new trend is emerging: a shift towards using systems programming languages like Rust to create the next generation of JavaScript tooling.

From bundlers (Turbopack) and transpilers (SWC) to linters and formatters, Rust is making its mark by offering unparalleled performance and reliability. This post explores why this "Rustification" is happening, the benefits it brings, and what it signals for the future of frontend development.
