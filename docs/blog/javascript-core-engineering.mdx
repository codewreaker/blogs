# A Look into JavaScript Core Engineering

We write JavaScript every day, but what happens under the hood when our code is executed? How does a line of human-readable code get turned into lightning-fast machine instructions? The magic lies within the JavaScript engine.

This post takes a peek behind the curtain into the world of JavaScript core engineering. We'll explore the basic architecture of an engine like V8, touching on concepts like the parser, the interpreter, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, and garbage collection.
