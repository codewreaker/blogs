summary: "Shell scripting has been my secret weapon for years. Here's why I keep coming back to it for quick commands, automation, and plain old developer joy."

There’s something poetic about the command line.

No, seriously. While others click through countless menus, I dance through tasks in a few keystrokes. Over the years, **shell scripts** have become my go-to tool—equal parts utility belt and love letter to simplicity.

## Why Shell Scripts?

Shell scripts are the closest thing I have to instant magic. I can chain together a few commands, save them to a `.sh` file, and suddenly repetitive tasks disappear. Need to:

- Rename 100 files?
- Spin up a local server and tail logs?
- Automate git tagging and deployment?

Shell scripts got me.

## Fast, Cheap, and Underappreciated

What I love most about shell scripting is the **minimalism**. No frameworks, no dependencies (beyond what’s already there), and no setup hell. It’s just:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.log; do
  gzip "$file"
done

That’s it. That’s the blog post.

Kidding—but you get the point.

Real Use Cases From My Daily Workflow

Here are a few things I use shell scripts for regularly:
	•	Quick deployment helpers:

# deploy.sh
git push origin main &&
ssh my-server "cd /app && git pull && npm run build"


	•	Data wrangling:

awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' users.csv | sort | uniq


	•	Sane aliases (via .bashrc or .zshrc):

alias gs='git status'
alias fuck='sudo $(history -p !!)'


	•	Generating timestamped backups:

cp config.json config-$(date +%F-%T).json



When Bash Fights Back

It’s not all roses. Bash has its quirks:
	•	Quoting rules are maddening.
	•	Error handling is primitive.
	•	Portability is hit-or-miss.

But like any good relationship, you learn to work through the weirdness. A little set -euo pipefail goes a long way.

Why I Keep Coming Back

Despite the alternatives—Python, Node.js CLI tools, GUI apps—shell scripts remain the fastest way to get things done when I’m deep in a terminal session.

They’re lightweight.
They’re everywhere.
And they work.

The TL;DR

Shell scripts might not be flashy, but they’re dependable, powerful, and elegant in their own right. For me, they’re not just tools—they’re companions in the craft.

“Give me a shell and I’ll automate the world.”
