Welcome to my journey of building a personal website with modern tools!

## Why Build a Website?

> "The best way to learn is by doing."

## Tech Stack

Here are some of the tools I used:

- **Next.js** for the React framework
- **MDX** for writing content with components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment

---

## Interactive Feature: Like Button

<LikeButton />

---

## Example Code

```jsx
function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>
      üëç {likes} Like{likes !== 1 ? 's' : ''}
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Start simple, iterate fast.
2. Use components for reusable UI.
3. Deploy early and often.
