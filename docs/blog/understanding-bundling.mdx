# Understanding Bundling

In modern web development, our code is often split into dozens or even hundreds of files called modules. While this is great for organization, browsers can't efficiently handle so many separate requests. This is where bundlers come in.

A module bundler is a tool that takes your JavaScript modules and their dependencies and combines them into a single file (or a few files) that can be efficiently loaded by a browser. In this post, we'll explore the core concepts behind bundling, such as dependency graphs, tree shaking, and code splitting, and look at how tools like Webpack, Vite, and Rollup tackle these challenges.
