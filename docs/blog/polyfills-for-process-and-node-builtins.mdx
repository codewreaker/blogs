# Polyfills: Handling `process` and Node.js Built-ins in the Browser

You're building a web application, you include a useful library from npm, and suddenly your browser console screams `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined`. What's going on?

Many libraries, especially older ones, were written with a Node.js environment in mind, using Node-specific global variables like `process` or built-in modules like `buffer` or `path`. These don't exist in the browser. This post will explain how modern bundlers like Vite and Webpack use polyfills to solve this problem, and what you need to know to configure them correctly.
