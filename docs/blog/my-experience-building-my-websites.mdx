# My Experience Building My Websites: A Journey Through Tech Stacks

Every developer's personal website is a snapshot of their skills, interests, and understanding of the web at a particular point in time. My own journey is no exception. From hand-cranked HTML and CSS to dynamic server-side apps and now to modern Jamstack architecture, my personal site has been my playground.

In this post, I'll take a walk down memory lane, discussing the different tech stacks I've used, the lessons I've learned, and the trade-offs I've made along the way.
