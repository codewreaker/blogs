# Module Federation Demystified

As applications grow, monolithic frontends can become difficult to manage and scale. Micro-frontend architecture aims to solve this by breaking down the UI into smaller, independently deployable pieces. Module Federation is a game-changing feature, popularized by Webpack 5, that makes implementing this architecture more feasible than ever.

This post will demystify Module Federation, explaining the core concepts of "hosts" and "remotes," how dependencies can be shared, and how you can dynamically load code from another application at runtime.
