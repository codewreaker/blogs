# CommonJS vs. ESM: A Modern JavaScript Dilemma

For a long time, JavaScript didn't have a native module system. Node.js solved this with CommonJS, giving us `require()` and `module.exports`. Then, the ECMAScript standard introduced ES Modules (ESM), bringing `import` and `export` to the language.

Today, we live in a world where both systems coexist, which can lead to confusion and compatibility issues. This article will dive into the key differences between CJS and ESM, their respective strengths, and how the ecosystem is moving towards a unified, ESM-first future.
